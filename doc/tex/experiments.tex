\subsection{Experimental Setup}
For our experiments we used a server with Intel i5-3470 with 3.20GHz speed. It has 4 socekts with 1 thread per socket. It has also 128 KiB L1d, 128 KiB L1i, 1MiB L2 and 6MiB cahce. The system also has 8 GB of DRAM. Due to the CPU architecture, we decided in our experiments to use 1-2-4 cores/threads, to test parallelization, because it does not support more threads per CPU.
