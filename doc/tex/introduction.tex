This work aims to study and benchmark four widely-used 
big data systems based on their performance in handling
complex queries. More specifically, the four systems
that were selected for the benchmarking are MonetDB, 
Postgres, Vertica, and MongoDB. The evaluation is 
based on their perfomance on running queries, which
include User-Defined Functions (UDFs).

The report begins by providing background information 
for every system, as well as, an overview 
of their main features and characteristics is provided.
The benchmarking process is then presented in detail; 
including the specific UDFs that were deployed in each system, 
the performance metrics that were collected, 
and the experimental setup that was used. 
The results are presented and analyzed, 
in terms of query execution time, 
based on data overload and resource utilization. 

% The report concludes by summarizing the main findings of the study and offering recommendations for data scientists and engineers who are looking to select a big data system for their data science projects. The report also highlights the limitations of the study and suggests potential areas for future research. Overall, the report aims to provide a comprehensive and objective comparison of the performance of the four big data systems and to help data scientists and engineers make informed decisions about which system is best suited for their specific data science needs.
