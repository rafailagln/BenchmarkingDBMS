\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


The purpose of this work is the study of various big data systems and their comparison in data science queries. We are essentially comparing MongoDB, MonetDB, PostgreSQL and VerticaDB to see how they can handle queries using User Defined Functions in Python. UDFs are functions written in various languages (that a system supports), and user can call them like embedded functions of the database.
