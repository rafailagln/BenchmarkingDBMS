\label{sec:monet}


MonetDB is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is optimized for analytical workloads. It uses a column-store approach, which is a different storage method than traditional row-based databases. This allows MonetDB to handle large amounts of data with high performance and efficiency. MonetDB is written in C and C++, and it supports SQL as query language. MonetDB is particularly suitable for data warehousing, business intelligence, and scientific research and it is scalable and can handle large datasets. MonetDB also supports multiple languages, including Python, making it easy to integrate with other tools and technologies.
