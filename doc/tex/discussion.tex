% Figures 1-4: 
% * column based faster (+Vertica and monetdb measurements outperforms others)
% * no significant improvements in hot and cold as expected (+citation)
% * queries: 
%     - zillow1: many nested calls
%     - Weblogs: join 
%     - zillow2, 311 aggregated
% * size of data differences: linear increase
% * postgres parallelism: no difference independently the query 
%     + reasons: query plan execution, #data, hardware
% * monetdb: same
% * vertica, only zillow2 (many aggregations), followed by weblogs which has join
%     - no difference on nested queries
% * mongodb: 
%     - 311 distinct -> logically no difference, same 250 to applyUDF -> 
%     - weblogs, zillow1, zillow2: applyUDF and every time splits data in more partitions 
%         (-) implementation has no safeguard on how many cores will be utilized
%     - native mongo much better (i.e. weblogs)
